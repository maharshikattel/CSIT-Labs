## Implementation & Demonstration of Sutherland Hudgeman polygon clipping algorithm. 
### Note: 
- show polygons with segments that are partially clipped by each boundary.
- take 8 points out of which, 4 are outside and 4 inside the clipping boundary.
- these points should connect 8 polygon segments which are each partially in based on each boundary.
